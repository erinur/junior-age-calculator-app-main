üìùBrief

Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
    Receive validation errors if:
    Any field is empty when the form is submitted
    The day number is not between 1-31
    The month number is not between 1-12
    The year is in the future
    The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.

üí°Ideas to test yourself

    Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus

    Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can

    Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is essential for professional developers
